# TypeScript Basics
### Basically just my notes on the [Understanding TypeScript](www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript) course by [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller)

If you have any advice/things you could add, feel free to make a fork and pull request or an issue!

Note 1: The comments are better read with the [Better Comments VSCode Extention](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments), I tried to colour code things by inquiries, information, and where errors happen.

Note 2: You may notice that some files have lots of errors that are unrelated to intentional typescript errors, these are because the compiled version (a .js file) and the initial version (.ts files) are conflicting with one another, because they're both defining the same things. If you'd like to experiment with these files yourself, I'd recommend deleting the compiled .js files before doing anything.

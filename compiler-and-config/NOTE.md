# IMPORTANT NOTE

I noticed that my last section was a bit hard to navigate because nothing had a distinctive name.
From this folder forward I'm going to try and seperate each section into their own file, named appropriately.
Sorry for any confusion in the basics section and I hope this works better for you and I :)

## NOTE 2:
Note that the markdown files in this directory **DO NOT** cover the full section of the course, as I'd just be re-writing what Max is saying, without providing any insight or explanatory code.
